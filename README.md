# TQs-Unstack-Shulkers-in-item-form
People will sometimes use like tweakeroo and carpet mod to stack empty shulker boxes. Machines that rely on shulker boxes in item form being unstacked (like with hoppers), can malfunction because of that.
This data pack unstacks those shulker box items, they retain all their properties like their motion and colour.
